Project Structure



Setup and Installation
1. Set up the SQLite database:
* Ensure your_database.db is placed in the data directory.
* Populate it with initial data as needed.
2. Run the Flask application:
     flask run
1. Navigate to the application in your web browser: Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
Usage
1. Select a dataset from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
2. Choose a forecasting model to apply from the available options.
3. View the forecasts and corresponding visualizations on the interactive dashboard.
4. Upload new data and retrain models interactively through the interface.
Model Development
ARIMA
* Purpose: Model and forecast time series data with non-stationarity or seasonal patterns.
* Configuration: Use ADF test for stationarity, and ACF/PACF plots for parameter estimation.
ANN
* Purpose: Model complex nonlinear relationships.
* Configuration: Design networks with varying architectures and train using historical data.
Hybrid ARIMA-ANN
* Purpose: Combine ARIMA's linear modeling with ANN's nonlinear capabilities.
* Configuration: Use ARIMA forecast results as input features to the ANN.
Additional Models
* SARIMA: For seasonal time series data.
* ETS: For data with trends and seasonalities.
* Prophet: For data with strong seasonal effects and irregularities.
* SVR: For nonlinear relationships using support vector machines.
* LSTM: For sequence prediction problems.
Frontend Development
Interface Design
* Purpose: Provide an intuitive interface for interacting with the forecasting system.
* Tools: ReactJS, HTML, CSS
Visualization Tools
* Purpose: Present data and forecasts visually.
* Tools: Chart.js or D3.js
Testing and Validation
Model Testing
* Purpose: Ensure reliability and accuracy of forecasting models.
* Process: Use historical data and cross-validation.
System Testing
* Purpose: Confirm backend and frontend functionality.
* Process: Conduct unit and integration tests.
